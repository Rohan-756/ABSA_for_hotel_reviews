# **Hotel Review Sentiment Predictor 🏨**

This application uses a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify hotel reviews into one of three sentiment categories: **Positive, Neutral, or Negative**. It is designed to demonstrate a complete machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to deployment using Streamlit.

## **Features**

* **Sentiment Prediction:** Uses a trained SVM model on text features (TF-IDF) to classify reviews.  
* **Improved Neutral Classification:** The model was trained using SMOTE to handle class imbalance, specifically targeting better performance on the Neutral category.  
* **Clear Output:** Shows the predicted numeric rating and sentiment with descriptive emojis.  
* **Streamlit Interface:** Provides a clean, interactive web interface for user input.  
* **Graceful Error Handling:** Includes warnings for empty input or loading failures.

## **Demo**

*Replace this placeholder with a screenshot of your running Streamlit app (e.g., demo\_screenshot.png).*

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   git clone \[https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-review-sentiment.git\](https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-review-sentiment.git)  
   cd hotel-review-sentiment

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):  
   python \-m venv venv  
   \# Linux/macOS  
   source venv/bin/activate  
   \# Windows  
   venv\\Scripts\\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

4. **Download the Model**:  
   Ensure your final trained model and vectorizer are saved together (e.g., using joblib.dump((vectorizer, svm), "models/final\_svm\_model\_improved.joblib")) and placed in the newly created models/ directory.

## **Usage**

1. **Run the Streamlit App**:  
   streamlit run app.py

2. Enter a hotel review in the text area.  
3. Click **Predict Sentiment**.  
4. View the predicted rating and sentiment in the output box.

## **Requirements**

Python 3.8+ and the libraries listed in requirements.txt:

pip install \-r requirements.txt

## **How It Works**

1. User enters a hotel review in the text area (app.py).  
2. The app loads the pre-trained vectorizer and LinearSVC model from the joblib file.  
3. The review text is cleaned (tokenized, stopwords removed, lemmatized).  
4. The cleaned review is transformed using the loaded vectorizer (TF-IDF).  
5. The SVM model predicts the numeric polarity:  
   * 1 → Positive 😊  
   * 0 → Neutral 😐  
   * \-1 → Negative 😢  
6. The app displays the result in a visually appealing box.
